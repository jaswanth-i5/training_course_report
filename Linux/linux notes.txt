INSTALLATION OF VirtualBox AND UBUNTU SETUP
-------------------------------------------
1) Install VirtualBox on Windows
	Download VirtualBox from its official site and run installer.
	Install by double-clicking the .vbox-extpack or from VirtualBox → File → Preferences → Extensions.

2) Prepare Ubuntu ISO
	Download an Ubuntu Desktop LTS ISO (e.g., 24.04 LTS) from ubuntu.com. Save it where you can browse to it.

3) Create a new virtual machine (VM)

	Open VirtualBox → New.
	Name: Ubuntu 
	ISO image: select ubuntu iso file (make sure this ubuntu-iso file in 'VirtualBox VMs' folder)
	Memory: 4096 MB (4 GB) recommended if your host has ≥8GB. If your host has 8GB total, use 2048 MB.
	Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now → VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) → Dynamically allocated → Size 30 GB (or at least 25 GB).

4) Configure VM settings (important)

	CPUs: assign 2 (or half of your cores; leave at least 2 for host).

5) Start the VM and install Ubuntu

	Select VM → Start. It boots from the ISO.
	Choose Try Ubuntu (optional) or Install Ubuntu. (Choose Install to proceed.)
	Follow installer:
		Select language, keyboard layout.
		Normal installation (includes utilities & browser) is fine.
		Choose Erase disk and install Ubuntu — this affects only the VM’s virtual disk, not your host drive.
		Set timezone, username, password.
		Wait until installation finishes, then reboot VM when prompted.

🔹 1. UNIX came first
	In the 1960s–70s, engineers at Bell Labs (AT&T) developed UNIX.
	It was revolutionary because it introduced:
		Multiuser support (many users can log in at once)
		Multitasking (run multiple programs at once)
		File-based structure (/home, /usr, /etc, etc.)
💡 UNIX became the foundation for many modern systems.

🔹 2. Linux was inspired by UNIX
	In 1991, Linus Torvalds (a Finnish student) wanted to make a free version of UNIX for his PC.
	He created the Linux kernel, which behaves like UNIX but is completely free and open-source.
👉 So, Linux = UNIX-like system, not UNIX itself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system — just like Windows and macOS.

🧠 An Operating System (OS) is software that manages:
	**Computer hardware (CPU, RAM, storage…)
	**Programs (apps)
	**User interaction (keyboard, mouse, screen…)
But one big difference:
	✅ Linux is open-source
	❌ Windows/macOS are closed-source


✅ Where do we use Linux?

Linux is everywhere!

	✔ 96% of Cloud servers run Linux
	✔ ALL supercomputers run Linux
	✔ Android OS is built on Linux
	✔ Websites, apps, databases — run on Linux servers
	✔ DevOps, Data Engineering → Linux skills required
	✔ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking → Linux mandatory
	✔ IoT Devices (routers, smart TVs, robots…)


✅ Why should you learn Linux?


	Linux is needed for:
	✔ Running servers (Node, Django, Java apps)
	✔ Managing PostgreSQL, MySQL databases
	✔ Using DevOps tools (Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD)
	✔ Cloud computing jobs (AWS, Azure)

Companies expect developers to deploy applications on Linux environments.


✅ How do we use Linux? (Very important 🔥)

	Linux can be used in 2 ways:

		1️⃣ GUI interface (like Windows)

			Click menus, open software visually
			Example: Ubuntu Desktop

		2️⃣ Command Line / Terminal (main focus for developers!)

			You type commands to control the system

	----------------------------------------------------------------------
	🔸 UNIX = The ancestor, closed-source, paid, old but stable.
	🔹 Linux = The child inspired by UNIX, open-source, free, and modern.
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	both share similar architecture:

		Terminal:          Displays output on your screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
++++++++++++++++++COMMANDS++++++++++++++++

Commands are case senstitive, so Date is NOT the same thing as date.
1. date
	-> Fri Oct 31 11:50:34 UTC 2025
2. ncal     ->new calendedar gives vertical calender
3. cal      ->old calender gives horizontal calender
4. clear    -> To clear screen

| command -options arguments  |
|_____________________________|

most commands support multiple options that modify their behavior. We can decide which option to include, if any, when we execute a command.

similarly, many commands accept arguments(the thing that the command acts upon or uses)
example::
$ echo mwahahaha
	->mwahahaha
The echo command is extremly simple. it takes the arguments we provide to it and print them out. it echoes them back at us.
$ ncal 2021       -> it gives entire year calender all 12 months of year 2021
$ ncal july 1969  -> it gives only july month of 1969 year

===================================================================================================================================

 man stands for manual
		It is used to display documentation for Linux commands, programs, system functions, and more.

Man Page Structure (What You’ll See Inside)

Most manual pages follow this structure:
-----------------------------------------
Section Title		Meaning
NAME				Command or function name + short description
SYNOPSIS			How to use it (syntax, options, parameters)
DESCRIPTION			Detailed explanation
OPTIONS	All	 		flags/switches (ex: -l, --help)
EXAMPLES			How to use it practically
FILES				Related system/config files
SEE ALSO			Similar commands or references
AUTHOR / BUGS		Author details & bug info

✅ Useful Man Page Commands (while reading)

Key	                Action
Space / Page Down	Scroll down
b	                Scroll up
q	                Quit
/ word	            Search for a word
n					Next search match
Shift + g			Go to end
1 + g				Go to start


📚 Linux Manual Sections (1 to 9)
		Manual pages are divided into 9 sections, each category containing specific types of documentation.
		Section	                  			Description
		1 – User Commands					Regular commands for users (like ls, cp, mkdir).
		2 – System Calls					Functions provided by the kernel (open, read, write).
		3 – Library Functions				C library functions (printf, scanf, malloc).
		4 – Special Files / Devices			Describes device files in /dev (like /dev/sda, /dev/null).
		5 – File Formats & Configuration    Files	Explains config files and formats (/etc/passwd, crontab syntax).
		6 – Games & Screensavers			Games available on the system (less important today).
		7 – Miscellaneous					Conventions, protocols, standards, etc. (like man 7 signal).
		8 – System Administration Commands	Commands for admin/root (mount, useradd, iptables).
		9 – Kernel Routines (Linux-specific)	Internal kernel functions used by developers.

==================================================================================================================================

🧠 What Is a Command in Linux?
--------------------------------
	A command in Linux is any instruction you type into the shell (terminal) that tells the operating system to perform a specific task 
		— such as listing files, copying data, or managing users.

⚙️ Main Types of Linux Commands
--------------------------------
Linux commands can be divided into 5 main categories:

Type	                            Description
----								-----------	
1. Internal (Built-in) Commands   	Commands built directly into the shell (no external program needed).	
                                    examples:: cd, echo, pwd, exit, history
2. External Commands	            Stored as separate executable files in system directories (like /bin, /usr/bin).	
									examples:: ls, cp, mv, grep, cat
3. Shell Scripts	                A file that contains a series of Linux commands written together.	
									examples:: ./backup.sh, bash script.sh
4. Alias Commands	                Shortcuts or custom names you create for longer commands.	
									examples:: alias ll='ls -l'
5. Functions	                    User-defined mini-programs inside the shell, similar to functions in programming languages.	
									examples:: myfunc() { echo "Hello $1"; }

🧭 How to Identify the Type of a Command
----------------------------------------
Use the type command:

 ________________
|                |
|  type command  |
|________________|

type cd       #cd is a shell builtin
type ls       #ls is aliased to 'ls --color=auto'
type echo     #echo is a shell builtin
type update   #

==================================================================================================================================

These commands help you:
	-> Move between folders
	-> Know where you currently are
	-> List files/folders
	-> Go back, up, or to home directory

1. pwd – Print Working Directory
	--> Shows the current location of your terminal. 
	example::
		pwd  #/home/jaswanth/Documents

2. ls – List Directory Contents
	--> Used to list files and folders in the current location.

	Command				Description
	ls					List files and folders
	ls -l				Long listing (details like permissions, size, owner, date)
	ls -a				Show hidden files (that start with .)
	ls -la				Long listing + hidden files
	ls /path			List contents of another directory
	  
3. cd – Change Directory 
	--> used to Move into folders from current directory.
	Command				Meaning
	cd foldername		Go inside a folder
	cd ..				Go back/up one level
	cd ../..			Go up two levels
	cd ~ or just cd		Go to Home directory

 # Navigation Exercise

Download the above file, **unzip it**, and drag the resulting **`Farm`** folder to your **Desktop**.    The Farm folder contains the following subdirectories:

```bash
Farm/
	Coop/ 
		Chickens/
		Geese/
	Stable/
		Horses/
```

**From this point forward, ONLY use the terminal to accomplish the following:**

1. Open a new terminal window. Navigate to the `Farm` folder.
		cd Farm
2. List the contents of the `Farm` directory.
		ls 
3. "Move" into the `Coop` folder.
		cd Coop
4. List the contents of the `Coop` folder.
		ls
		--> Chickens,Geese
5. "Move" into the `Chickens` folder.
		cd Chickens
6. List out the chickens in the `Chickens` folder.  How many are there?
		ls
		-->6
7. One of the chickens is very very old, which one is it? (which file in the `Chickens` folder has the oldest modification time?) Use a command to figure it out!
		ls --sort=time -la
		-->Elvis , feb 14
8. In a **single** command, move from the `Chickens` directory to the `Geese` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above if needed.
		cd ~/Farm/Coop/Grees
		cd /home/jaswanth/Farm/Coop/Grees
9. How many geese (files) are in the `Geese` directory?
		ls
		-->4
10. One of the geese is sitting on a golden egg!  It's larger than the other geese. Which one is it?  
	(which file in the `Geese` folder is the largest?).  Use a command to figure it out!
		ls -l --sort=size 
		-->Muffin
11. Navigate to the `Horses` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above, if needed.
		cd ../../Stable/Horese
12. How many horses are in the `Horses` directory?
		ls 
		-->4
13. Wait! There is a hidden horse in the `Horses` directory! What is it's name??
		ls -la
		-->Tory

=============================================================================================
+++++++++++++++++++++         CREATING FILES AND FOLDERS                 ++++++++++++++++++++
=============================================================================================

1. Create a Folder (Directory)
	mkdir --> make directories
		mkdir [OPTION]... Directory...
		--> Create the directory(ies), if they do not already exist.
 
	Command								Description
	mkdir folder_name					Creates a folder.
	mkdir folder1 folder2				Creates multiple folders.
	mkdir -p parent/child1/child2		Creates nested folders (also creates parent folder if it doesn't exist).

		Examples::
			mkdir my_folder                 
			mkdir folderA folderB
			mkdir -p projects/python/app

2. Exploring file type
	file --> determine file type
			 file prints the type of that file
		example::
			file colors.txt
				-->colors.txt: ASCII text
			file Farm
				-->Farm: directory

3. Create a File

	There are multiple ways to create a file:
		TOUCH--> 
					----touch [OPTIONS]..FILE----
				update the access and modification times of each file to the current time.
				 A file argument that does not exits is created empty, unlwss -c or -h is supplied
				used to create a new file from the command line.  touch filename.ext
				if we try to se touch with a file that already exits,it will simply update the access and modification dates to current time. 

	Command						Use Case
	touch filename				Creates an empty file or updates timestamp if file exists.
	cat > filename				Create a file and write content. (Press Ctrl + D to save and exit).
	nano filename				Opens a text editor to write content.
	echo "text" > filename		Creates a file with text (overwrites if exists).
	echo "text" >> filename		Adds text to the end of a file (append mode).

	Examples::
		touch notes.txt
		touch app.js index.html style.css		# creating multiple files at a time
		cat > todo.txt         		           	# Type text, then press Ctrl + D to save
		nano report.txt       					# Write, then press Ctrl + O (save) and Ctrl + X (exit)
		echo "Hello Linux" > file1.txt
		echo "More content" >> file1.txt

Making Files And Folders Exercise
----------------------------------
	1.Create a new folder called my-app
		mkdir my-app
	2.Navigate to my-app and inside create two new empty files called README.md and package.json
		cd my-app
		touch README.md package.json
	3.Still inside of my-app create a new folder called public. Without cd-ing into public, create an index.html file inside of it.
		mkdir public 
		touch public/index.html
	4.Create a new folder called src inside of my-app.  Navigate inside of it.
		mkdir src 
		cd src
	5.Using a single line, create the following four files inside of src: App.css, App.js, index.css, and index.js
		touch App.css App.js index.css index.js
	Your folder structure should now look like this:
		my-app/
		  README.md
		  package.json
		  public/
		    index.html
		  src/
		    App.css
		    App.js
		    index.css
		    index.js
	BONUS:
💡 		Using a single command, create a new directory inside of `src` called `components`,
		and inside of that new `components` directory create a new directory called `Navbar`.   
		Do this using a single command, without first creating the `components` directory.
			
			mkdir -p components/Navbar

	## Part 1

	1. Open up the `recipe.txt` file using `nano`
		cd NanoExercise
		nano recipe.txt
	2. On line 3, add your own name after `Author:` so that it says `Author: Stevie Wonder` or whatever your name is
		jaswanth kumar
	3. Whoever wrote this recipe didn't know how to spell "parmesan", so instead they wrote "parm".  
		Please update the two instances of "Parm" to "Parmesan".  
		You can do this manually or by using nano's replace feature.
		Ctrl+\ --> parm -- enter --parmesan  --> y
	4. Write out your changes! Close the file.
		ctrl+O
		enter for file name
		ctrl+x

	## Part 2

	1. Open up the `website.html` file with `nano`
		nano website.html
	2. This html file contains a simple website for a fictional restaurant called "Ristorante Colt".  
		You recently purchased the restaurant and have decided to change its name! 
		Please replace all instance of "Ristorante Colt" with your new restaurant's name.  
		Do this using a nano shortcut, rather than manually replacing each one.

	Before we can delete, move, or copy things...we need things! It's time to get some more practice using `touch` and `mkdir`

	Please create a new directory somewhere on your machine called `Bootcamp`.  Inside of it, create the the folders and files indicated below:

	```bash
	**Bootcamp/**
		**FallCohort/**
			Italo.txt
			Edgar.txt
			Linus.txt
			Sara.txt 
			Silvio.txt
			**Waitlist/**
				Hanna.txt
				Haris.txt
				Netta.txt
		**WinterCohort/**
			Santiago.txt
			Iris.txt
			Naomi.txt
	```

	- Sadly `Edgar` had to drop out of the course.  Delete the `Edgar.txt` file in `FallCohort`
		rm Bootcamp/fallcohort/edgar.txt

	- This means we now have space in our Fall Cohort to move someone off of the waitlist.  Please move `Netta.txt` from the `Waitlist` folder into the `FallCohort` folder.
		mv Bootcamp/fallcohort/waitlist/netta.txt Bootcamp/fallcohort/

	- Please delete the `Waitlist` folder and its contents
		m -r Bootcamp/fallcohort/waitlist/*
	
	- It turns out that I misspelled Sara.  She spells her name "Sarah" with an "h" at the end.  Please rename the `Sara.txt` file to `Sarah.txt`
		mv fallcohort/sara.txt fallcohort/sarah.txt
	
	- Unfortunately Italo is having a bit of a personal emergency, and he would like to move to our WinterCohort.  
		Please move the `Italo.txt` file from `FallCohort` to the `WinterCohort` folder
		mv italo.txt waitlist/
	
	- Oh no, our entire Winter Cohort had to be cancelled because of a worldwide pandemic :(   We decided to bump all of the scheduled winter students to spring. 
		In the `Bootcamp` directory create a copy of the `WinterCohort` folder called `SpringCohort`
		rm -r Bootcamp/fallcohort/waitlist
	
	- Please rename the WinterCohort folder to `WinterCohortCANCELLED`
		mv Bootcamp/WinterCohort Bootcamp/WinterCohortCANCELLED

	- Oh no! We're going out of business. Please delete the entire `Bootcamp` directory 😢
		rm -r Bootcamp

=============================================================================================

1. cat — Concatenate and View File Contents
	Reads a file sequentially (line-by-line from start to end)
	Displays output to STDOUT (screen)
	Can create, append, or combine files
		example::
		--> cat filename.txt
	Create a new file
		cat > notes.txt
		# write content
		CTRL + D to save & exit
	Append to existing file
		cat >> notes.txt
				# Adds content without deleting old content
	Display with line numbers
		cat -n filename.txt
	Combine files
		Cat part1.txt part2.txt > final.txt
2. less — Page Viewer for Large Files
	Loads files page-by-page instead of fully into memory
	Doesn’t modify file — just for reading
	Faster for large logs (e.g., GB files)
	Example::
	--> less filename.txt

3. tac — Reverse Display of File

	Prints file from last line → first line
	Useful when latest logs are at bottom
		example::
		--> tac logfile.txt
	Real use: debug apps by checking latest log entry first


4. rev — Reverse Characters Per Line
    Reverses each line’s characters, not line order
	Example:
		echo "Linux" | rev
	Output:
		xuniL

	$ cat jkf.txt                        rev jkf.txt
	--> hello jk                          --> kj olleh
