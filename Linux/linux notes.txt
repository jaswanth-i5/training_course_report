🔹 1. UNIX came first
	In the 1960s–70s, engineers at Bell Labs (AT&T) developed UNIX.
	It was revolutionary because it introduced:
		Multiuser support (many users can log in at once)
		Multitasking (run multiple programs at once)
		File-based structure (/home, /usr, /etc, etc.)
💡 UNIX became the foundation for many modern systems.

🔹 2. Linux was inspired by UNIX
	In 1991, Linus Torvalds (a Finnish student) wanted to make a free version of UNIX for his PC.
	He created the Linux kernel, which behaves like UNIX but is completely free and open-source.
👉 So, Linux = UNIX-like system, not UNIX itself.

✅ What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system — just like Windows and macOS.

🧠 An Operating System (OS) is software that manages:
	**Computer hardware (CPU, RAM, storage…)
	**Programs (apps)
	**User interaction (keyboard, mouse, screen…)
But one big difference:
	✅ Linux is open-source
	❌ Windows/macOS are closed-source


✅ Where do we use Linux?

Linux is everywhere!

✔ 96% of Cloud servers run Linux
✔ ALL supercomputers run Linux
✔ Android OS is built on Linux
✔ Websites, apps, databases — run on Linux servers
✔ DevOps, Data Engineering → Linux skills required
✔ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking → Linux mandatory
✔ IoT Devices (routers, smart TVs, robots…)

So learning Linux = career power ✅

✅ Why should you learn Linux?

Since you are learning backend + DB + DevOps tools like Git/GitHub:

Linux is needed for:
✔ Running servers (Node, Django, Java apps)
✔ Managing PostgreSQL, MySQL databases
✔ Using DevOps tools (Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD)
✔ Cloud computing jobs (AWS, Azure)

Companies expect developers to deploy applications on Linux environments.


✅ How do we use Linux? (Very important 🔥)

Linux can be used in 2 ways:

1️⃣ GUI interface (like Windows)

Click menus, open software visually
Example: Ubuntu Desktop

2️⃣ Command Line / Terminal (main focus for developers!)

You type commands to control the system

----------------------------------------------------------------------
🔸 UNIX = The ancestor, closed-source, paid, old but stable.
🔹 Linux = The child inspired by UNIX, open-source, free, and modern.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
both share similar architecture:
__________________________________

User
|
│   type our commands in terminal
│  (commands)
▼
Shell
|
│   interpreter that understands your commands
│  (passes commands to karnel) (bash -- defalut)
▼
Kernel
│
|   engine that does the actual work
│  (controls)
▼
Hardware
______________________________________________________

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Part	        Role
------------------------------------------------------------------
Terminal	The screen where you type our commands
Shell	        The interpreter that understands your commands(default BASH)
Kernel	        The engine that does the actual work
------------------------------------------------------------------
Bash is the default SHELL in most Linux systems.



Practical Example:
 ________________________________
|$ ls                            |
|                                |
|Documents  Downloads  Pictures  |
|________________________________|

Terminal:          The window you see
Bash (Shell):      Reads ls, sends it to Kernel
Kernel:            Gets folder list from hard drive
Terminal:          Displays output on your screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
++++++++++++++++++COMMANDS++++++++++++++++

Commands are case senstitive, so Date is NOT the same thing as date.
1. date
	-> Fri Oct 31 11:50:34 UTC 2025
2. ncal     ->new calendedar gives vertical calender
3. cal      ->old calender gives horizontal calender
4. clear    -> To clear screen 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+++++++++++++++++COMMAND STRUCTURE++++++++++++++
 _____________________________
|                             |
| command -options arguments  |
|_____________________________|

most commands support multiple options that modify their behavior. We can decide which option to include, if any, when we execute a command.

similarly, many commands accept arguments(the thing that the command acts upon or uses)
example::
$ echo mwahahaha
	->mwahahaha
The echo command is extremly simple. it takes the arguments we provide to it and print them out. it echoes them back at us.
$ ncal 2021       -> it gives entire year calender all 12 months of year 2021
$ ncal july 1969  -> it gives only july month of 1969 year
