INSTALLATION OF VirtualBox AND UBUNTU SETUP
-------------------------------------------
1) Install VirtualBox on Windows
	Download VirtualBox from its official site and run installer.
	Install by double-clicking the .vbox-extpack or from VirtualBox → File → Preferences → Extensions.

2) Prepare Ubuntu ISO
	Download an Ubuntu Desktop LTS ISO (e.g., 24.04 LTS) from ubuntu.com. Save it where you can browse to it.

3) Create a new virtual machine (VM)

	Open VirtualBox → New.
	Name: Ubuntu 
	ISO image: select ubuntu iso file (make sure this ubuntu-iso file in 'VirtualBox VMs' folder)
	Memory: 4096 MB (4 GB) recommended if your host has ≥8GB. If your host has 8GB total, use 2048 MB.
	Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now → VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) → Dynamically allocated → Size 30 GB (or at least 25 GB).

4) Configure VM settings (important)

	CPUs: assign 2 (or half of your cores; leave at least 2 for host).

5) Start the VM and install Ubuntu

	Select VM → Start. It boots from the ISO.
	Choose Try Ubuntu (optional) or Install Ubuntu. (Choose Install to proceed.)
	Follow installer:
		Select language, keyboard layout.
		Normal installation (includes utilities & browser) is fine.
		Choose Erase disk and install Ubuntu — this affects only the VM’s virtual disk, not your host drive.
		Set timezone, username, password.
		Wait until installation finishes, then reboot VM when prompted.

🔹 1. UNIX came first
	In the 1960s–70s, engineers at Bell Labs (AT&T) developed UNIX.
	It was revolutionary because it introduced:
		Multiuser support (many users can log in at once)
		Multitasking (run multiple programs at once)
		File-based structure (/home, /usr, /etc, etc.)
💡 UNIX became the foundation for many modern systems.

🔹 2. Linux was inspired by UNIX
	In 1991, Linus Torvalds (a Finnish student) wanted to make a free version of UNIX for his PC.
	He created the Linux kernel, which behaves like UNIX but is completely free and open-source.
👉 So, Linux = UNIX-like system, not UNIX itself.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system — just like Windows and macOS.

🧠 An Operating System (OS) is software that manages:
	**Computer hardware (CPU, RAM, storage…)
	**Programs (apps)
	**User interaction (keyboard, mouse, screen…)
But one big difference:
	✅ Linux is open-source
	❌ Windows/macOS are closed-source


✅ Where do we use Linux?

Linux is everywhere!

✔ 96% of Cloud servers run Linux
✔ ALL supercomputers run Linux
✔ Android OS is built on Linux
✔ Websites, apps, databases — run on Linux servers
✔ DevOps, Data Engineering → Linux skills required
✔ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking → Linux mandatory
✔ IoT Devices (routers, smart TVs, robots…)

So learning Linux = career power ✅

✅ Why should you learn Linux?

Since you are learning backend + DB + DevOps tools like Git/GitHub:

Linux is needed for:
✔ Running servers (Node, Django, Java apps)
✔ Managing PostgreSQL, MySQL databases
✔ Using DevOps tools (Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD)
✔ Cloud computing jobs (AWS, Azure)

Companies expect developers to deploy applications on Linux environments.


✅ How do we use Linux? (Very important 🔥)

Linux can be used in 2 ways:

1️⃣ GUI interface (like Windows)

Click menus, open software visually
Example: Ubuntu Desktop

2️⃣ Command Line / Terminal (main focus for developers!)

You type commands to control the system

----------------------------------------------------------------------
🔸 UNIX = The ancestor, closed-source, paid, old but stable.
🔹 Linux = The child inspired by UNIX, open-source, free, and modern.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
both share similar architecture:

Terminal	The screen where you type our commands
Shell	        The interpreter that understands your commands(default BASH)
Kernel	        The engine that does the actual work

Bash is the default SHELL in most Linux systems.



Practical Example:

Terminal:          The window you see
Bash (Shell):      Reads ls, sends it to Kernel
Kernel:            Gets folder list from hard drive
Terminal:          Displays output on your screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
++++++++++++++++++COMMANDS++++++++++++++++

Commands are case senstitive, so Date is NOT the same thing as date.
1. date
	-> Fri Oct 31 11:50:34 UTC 2025
2. ncal     ->new calendedar gives vertical calender
3. cal      ->old calender gives horizontal calender
4. clear    -> To clear screen 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+++++++++++++++++COMMAND STRUCTURE++++++++++++++
 _____________________________
|                             |
| command -options arguments  |
|_____________________________|

most commands support multiple options that modify their behavior. We can decide which option to include, if any, when we execute a command.

similarly, many commands accept arguments(the thing that the command acts upon or uses)
example::
$ echo mwahahaha
	->mwahahaha
The echo command is extremly simple. it takes the arguments we provide to it and print them out. it echoes them back at us.
$ ncal 2021       -> it gives entire year calender all 12 months of year 2021
$ ncal july 1969  -> it gives only july month of 1969 year

===================================================================================================================================

📘 man stands for manual
		It is used to display documentation for Linux commands, programs, system functions, and more.

🧠 Man Page Structure (What You’ll See Inside)

Most manual pages follow this structure:
-----------------------------------------
Section Title		Meaning
NAME				Command or function name + short description
SYNOPSIS			How to use it (syntax, options, parameters)
DESCRIPTION			Detailed explanation
OPTIONS	All	 		flags/switches (ex: -l, --help)
EXAMPLES			How to use it practically
FILES				Related system/config files
SEE ALSO			Similar commands or references
AUTHOR / BUGS		Author details & bug info

✅ Useful Man Page Commands (while reading)
---------------------------------------------
Key	                Action
Space / Page Down	Scroll down
b	                Scroll up
q	                Quit
/ word	            Search for a word
n					Next search match
Shift + g			Go to end
1 + g				Go to start


📚 Linux Manual Sections (1 to 9)
		Manual pages are divided into 9 sections, each category containing specific types of documentation.
		Section	                  			Description
		1 – User Commands					Regular commands for users (like ls, cp, mkdir).
		2 – System Calls					Functions provided by the kernel (open, read, write).
		3 – Library Functions				C library functions (printf, scanf, malloc).
		4 – Special Files / Devices			Describes device files in /dev (like /dev/sda, /dev/null).
		5 – File Formats & Configuration    Files	Explains config files and formats (/etc/passwd, crontab syntax).
		6 – Games & Screensavers			Games available on the system (less important today).
		7 – Miscellaneous					Conventions, protocols, standards, etc. (like man 7 signal).
		8 – System Administration Commands	Commands for admin/root (mount, useradd, iptables).
		9 – Kernel Routines (Linux-specific)	Internal kernel functions used by developers.

==================================================================================================================================

🧠 What Is a Command in Linux?
--------------------------------
	A command in Linux is any instruction you type into the shell (terminal) that tells the operating system to perform a specific task 
		— such as listing files, copying data, or managing users.

⚙️ Main Types of Linux Commands
--------------------------------
Linux commands can be divided into 5 main categories:

Type	                            Description
----								-----------	
1. Internal (Built-in) Commands   	Commands built directly into the shell (no external program needed).	
                                    examples:: cd, echo, pwd, exit, history
2. External Commands	            Stored as separate executable files in system directories (like /bin, /usr/bin).	
									examples:: ls, cp, mv, grep, cat
3. Shell Scripts	                A file that contains a series of Linux commands written together.	
									examples:: ./backup.sh, bash script.sh
4. Alias Commands	                Shortcuts or custom names you create for longer commands.	
									examples:: alias ll='ls -l'
5. Functions	                    User-defined mini-programs inside the shell, similar to functions in programming languages.	
									examples:: myfunc() { echo "Hello $1"; }

🧭 How to Identify the Type of a Command
----------------------------------------
Use the type command:

 ________________
|                |
|  type command  |
|________________|

type cd       #cd is a shell builtin
type ls       #ls is aliased to 'ls --color=auto'
type echo     #echo is a shell builtin
type update   #

+++++++++++++++++++++🧭 Navigation Commands in Linux (File System Travel)++++++++++++++++++++
=============================================================================================

These commands help you:
	-> Move between folders
	-> Know where you currently are
	-> List files/folders
	-> Go back, up, or to home directory

1. pwd – Print Working Directory
	--> Shows the current location of your terminal. 
	example::
		pwd  #/home/jaswanth/Documents

2. ls – List Directory Contents
	--> Used to list files and folders in the current location.

	Command				Description
	ls					List files and folders
	ls -l				Long listing (details like permissions, size, owner, date)
	ls -a				Show hidden files (that start with .)
	ls -la				Long listing + hidden files
	ls /path			List contents of another directory
	  
3. cd – Change Directory 
	--> used to Move into folders from current directory.
	Command				Meaning
	cd foldername		Go inside a folder
	cd ..				Go back/up one level
	cd ../..			Go up two levels
	cd ~ or just cd		Go to Home directory
	cd /				Go to root directory (/)
	cd /path/to/folder	Go to specific path

 # Navigation Exercise

Download the above file, **unzip it**, and drag the resulting **`Farm`** folder to your **Desktop**.    The Farm folder contains the following subdirectories:

```bash
Farm/
	Coop/ 
		Chickens/
		Geese/
	Stable/
		Horses/
```

**From this point forward, ONLY use the terminal to accomplish the following:**

1. Open a new terminal window. Navigate to the `Farm` folder.
		cd Farm
2. List the contents of the `Farm` directory.
		ls 
3. "Move" into the `Coop` folder.
		cd Coop
4. List the contents of the `Coop` folder.
		ls
		--> Chickens,Geese
5. "Move" into the `Chickens` folder.
		cd Chickens
6. List out the chickens in the `Chickens` folder.  How many are there?
		ls
		-->6
7. One of the chickens is very very old, which one is it? (which file in the `Chickens` folder has the oldest modification time?) Use a command to figure it out!
		ls --sort=time -la
		-->Elvis , feb 14
8. In a **single** command, move from the `Chickens` directory to the `Geese` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above if needed.
		cd ~/Farm/Coop/Grees
		cd /home/jaswanth/Farm/Coop/Grees
9. How many geese (files) are in the `Geese` directory?
		ls
		-->4
10. One of the geese is sitting on a golden egg!  It's larger than the other geese. Which one is it?  (which file in the `Geese` folder is the largest?).  Use a command to figure it out!
		ls -l --sort=size 
		-->Muffin
11. Navigate to the `Horses` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above, if needed.
		cd ../../Stable/Horese
12. How many horses are in the `Horses` directory?
		ls 
		-->4
13. Wait! There is a hidden horse in the `Horses` directory! What is it's name??
		ls -la
		-->Tory

=============================================================================================
+++++++++++++++++++++         CREATING FILES AND FOLDERS                 ++++++++++++++++++++
=============================================================================================

1. Create a File

	There are multiple ways to create a file:
		TOUCH--> 
					----touch [OPTIONS]..FILE----
				update the access and modification times of each file to the current time.
				 A file argument that does not exits is created empty, unlwss -c or -h is supplied
				used to create a new file from the command line.  touch filename.ext
				if we try to se touch with a file that already exits,it will simply update the access and modification dates to current time. 

	Command						Use Case
	touch filename				Creates an empty file or updates timestamp if file exists.
	cat > filename				Create a file and write content. (Press Ctrl + D to save and exit).
	nano filename				Opens a text editor to write content.
	echo "text" > filename		Creates a file with text (overwrites if exists).
	echo "text" >> filename		Adds text to the end of a file (append mode).

	Examples::
		touch notes.txt
		cat > todo.txt         		# Type text, then press Ctrl + D to save
		nano report.txt       		# Write, then press Ctrl + O (save) and Ctrl + X (exit)
		echo "Hello Linux" > 		file1.txt
		echo "More content" >> 		file1.txt

2. Create a Folder (Directory)
	Command								Description
	mkdir folder_name					Creates a folder.
	mkdir folder1 folder2				Creates multiple folders.
	mkdir -p parent/child1/child2		Creates nested folders (also creates parent folder if it doesn't exist).

		Examples::
			mkdir my_folder                 
			mkdir folderA folderB
			mkdir -p projects/python/app
